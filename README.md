JagCoach Backend

## Description
This is the backend to Jagcoach, as of now it handles video transcription, speech analysis, and AI feedback utilizing ChatGPT.

I haven't had the need to create two repositories before so hopefully the instructions will help.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/Dwafsigil/jagcoach-backend.git cd jagcoach-backend)
2. Set up the Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies (To set up the environment run, "python3 -m venv venv". To activate the environment, run "source venv/bin/activate:".
Then install all dependencies, "pip install -r requirements.txt". 
3. Run the backend, "python app.py"
